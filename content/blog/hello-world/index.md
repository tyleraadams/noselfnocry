description: "How to free yourself from your self"

This blog (yes, a blog... in 2019, _gasp_) is my attempt to wrap my head around some Buddhist teachings and practices I have been encountering over the last year (one **big** caveat: I am a layperson from North America, so I am not by any means an expert on Buddhism. Again, this blog is a way for me to process what I am learning.)

I was at a strange place in my life where things on paper were going well in terms of my professional and private lives, but I felt like a total failure, an imposter. I think this feeling is pretty common, but for me it started to take over my entire life to the point where I was making my self sick, physically and emotionally.

I started to try to cope by over-exercising. But no matter how many miles a day I ran, I couldn't shake it (in fact, I ended up injuring my ankle from overuse). I tried anti-depressants, but they weren't very effective, either. I was pretty sure my world was going to collapse at any moment.

I finally had the good sense to Google `meditation center near me`. And it ended up saving my life.

I began attending classes on how to meditate. I learned to sit with my thoughts, watch them bubble up, sit there, and finally, as long as I didn't feed them, observe as they dissipate. A common metaphor for this phenomenon is clouds moving across an otherwise clear sky. The sky is pure and clear, and the clouds themselves are just temporary appearances. What I really learned, or began learning, was the path, or the truth of reality. How reality really works.

That may sound a little hippy-dippy. But the truth of the matter is that our thoughts, beliefs and feelings _are_ our reality. That means that we have the ability to create our own reality. What could be more empowering and liberating than that? There is nothing magical about it, it's just how things are.

So that's the background how I came to Buddhist teachings. What I want to really explore over the course of this blog is the idea of "not-self", or [anatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatta) in Pali, which has been a particularly freeing idea for me. This teaching is one that I will probably grapple with the rest of my life. It's a teaching that has often been misunderstood, and is somewhat controversial. To be clear, as I understand it, the Buddha did not mean that there is _no_ self, although that's how it is sometimes framed. Rather, the self is _real_ but only insofar as a social convention.

There is no essence to our self, nothing that is at the core of our being that can define us (other than our clear minds that can perceive the world.) That idea, so straightforward in some ways, is incredibly freeing. We suffer so much because of the expectations we have for ourselves, and the way we believe we are or are not meeting those expectations. "Not-self" frees us because the self we are so critical of does not exist, at least not in the way it appears to us.

A really accessible introduction to this concept can be found in a recent episode "Self As A Verb" of a wonderful podcast [Audio Dharma](https://www.audiodharma.org/). Andrea Fella proposes that we view the self as a process, not a thing. When we attribute thing-ness to something that is not permanent, it causes suffering. She tells the story of coming to terms with her own self-hatred in meditation. Like any other experience, self-aversion is a set of causes and conditions. She was able to short-circuit her self-hatred by recognizing that the mind was _believing_ the self-generated thought "I am a failure". Once the mind can identify the process that leads to suffering, it can avoid falling into harmful patterns like this one.

So this is a little taste of what I'd like to do with this blog. Thank you for reading, and come back soon for more <3.
